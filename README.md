# Client for my REST API 

###### What I used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Heroku, cURL, PHP

This is the client side of my REST API that I created for a university project. The whole project is a combination of a wishlist and an organization tool for managing gifts that we buy for others. It consists of a server connected to a MySQL database and a client side, which are connected through a REST API.

This is the repository of the client side. It is an independent web application that allows users to create their accounts, make wishlists, add new gifts and see other users' wishlists to find perfect gifts for their loved ones. It is connected with a server application through REST API (using cURL to send HTTP request). Then it presents the received data to the users. It provides an interface for creating a new account, adding gifts and arranging them into wishlists. It also deletes and edits data from the database if needed. The frontend was created using Bootstrap.
